# 🎬 Bollywood GraphRAG

A complete GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built on a **Bollywood knowledge graph**. Ask questions about Hindi cinema in plain English — the system finds the answer by traversing a Neo4j graph of movies, actors, directors, composers, and awards, then generating a natural language response via GPT-4o.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Desktop | Latest | Must be running |
| Python | 3.11+ | For running scripts locally |
| OpenAI API key | — | Required for embeddings + GPT-4o |

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd bollywood-graphrag

# Copy the env template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI key
```

Your `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=supplychain!
```

### 2. Start Neo4j

```bash
docker compose up neo4j -d

# Wait ~15 seconds, then verify:
docker compose logs neo4j | grep "Started"
```

Open the Neo4j Browser at http://localhost:7474 (user: `neo4j`, password: `supplychain!`)

### 3. Install Python dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Load the knowledge graph

```bash
cd src
python loader.py
```

Expected output:
```
[1/2] Loading nodes...
  ✓ Constraints active
  ✓ 35 Person nodes
  ✓ 26 Movie nodes
  ✓ 10 ProductionHouse nodes
  ✓ 25 Award nodes

[2/2] Loading relationships...
  ✓ 41 ACTED_IN relationships
  ✓ 27 DIRECTED relationships
  ...
```

### 5. Add vector embeddings

```bash
python embeddings.py
```

This calls the OpenAI embeddings API for each node and stores the vectors in Neo4j. Run once; re-running is safe (overwrites existing embeddings).

### 6. Start the FastAPI backend

The Streamlit app talks to FastAPI over HTTP — FastAPI must be running first.

```bash
# Still inside src/
uvicorn api:app --reload --port 8000
```

Leave this terminal running. Open http://localhost:8000/docs to confirm it's up.

### 7. Run the Streamlit app

Open a **new terminal**, activate the venv, then:

```bash
cd src
streamlit run app.py
```

Open http://localhost:8501

> **Note:** You need both terminals running at the same time — one for FastAPI, one for Streamlit. Neo4j (Docker) must also be up. The easiest way to run everything together is Docker Compose (step 8).

### 8. (Recommended) Start everything with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Neo4j Browser | http://localhost:7474 |
| FastAPI docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Streamlit chat | http://localhost:8501 |

---

## Usage

### Streamlit Chat Interface

The **💬 Chat** page lets you ask natural language questions. Try:

- *"Which films has Shah Rukh Khan done with Yash Raj Films?"*
- *"Which music composers have worked with Aamir Khan productions?"*
- *"Name all the National Award winning films in the graph."*
- *"Which actors directed by Rajkumar Hirani also worked with AR Rahman?"*

The **🔍 Explore** page lets you look up any entity by name and see its full graph neighbourhood.

### FastAPI Endpoints

```bash
# Ask a question
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Which films did Aamir Khan direct?", "top_k": 3, "hops": 2}'

# Vector search
curl "http://localhost:8000/search?q=revenge+thriller&label=Movie"

# Get an entity's neighbourhood
curl "http://localhost:8000/graph/Dangal?label=Movie&hops=2"

# Filmography of a person
curl "http://localhost:8000/person/AR%20Rahman/filmography"

# Graph statistics
curl "http://localhost:8000/stats"
```

## How the GraphRAG Pipeline Works

```
User question (text)
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Vector Search            │  Embed question → find top-k similar nodes
│     (embeddings.py)          │  e.g. "Who directed PK?" → [Rajkumar Hirani, PK]
└──────────────────┬───────────┘
                   │  top-k node identifiers
                   ▼
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  2. Graph Traversal          │  Walk N hops from each identified node
│     (graphrag.py)            │  Collect all connected facts as triples
└──────────────────┬───────────┘
                   │  subgraph as structured text
                   ▼
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  3. LLM Answer Generation    │  GPT-4o reasons over graph context
│     (OpenAI GPT-4o)          │  Returns grounded, verifiable answer
└──────────────────────────────┘

## Extending the Project

### Adding more movies
Add entries to `MOVIES`, `ACTED_IN`, `DIRECTED` etc. in `src/data/bollywood_data.py`, then re-run `loader.py` and `embeddings.py`.

### Adding a new relationship type
1. Add rows to the relevant list in `bollywood_data.py`
2. Add a loading function in `loader.py`
3. Call it from `load_all()`

### Switching to a different LLM
Replace the `openai` calls in `graphrag.py` with any OpenAI-compatible API (Anthropic, Gemini, Groq etc.).

## Interesting Graph Queries to Try in Neo4j Browser

```cypher
-- All Aamir Khan films with box office > 200 crore
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Aamir Khan'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.box_office_crore > 200
RETURN m.title, m.year, m.box_office_crore ORDER BY m.box_office_crore DESC

-- Directors who also acted in their own films
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p)
RETURN p.name, m.title

-- Movies where AR Rahman composed and the film won a National Award
MATCH (ar:Person {name:'AR Rahman'})-[:COMPOSED_MUSIC_FOR]->(m:Movie)-[:WON]->(a:Award)
WHERE a.category = 'National'
RETURN m.title, a.name

-- Shortest path between Shah Rukh Khan and AR Rahman
MATCH path = shortestPath(
    (a:Person {name: 'Shah Rukh Khan'})-[*]-(b:Person {name: 'AR Rahman'})
)
RETURN [n IN nodes(path) | coalesce(n.name, n.title)] AS path, length(path) AS hops

-- All films produced by Yash Raj that crossed 500 crore
MATCH (ph:ProductionHouse {name: 'Yash Raj Films'})-[:PRODUCED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.box_office_crore > 500
RETURN m.title, m.year, m.box_office_crore ORDER BY m.box_office_crore DESC
```
